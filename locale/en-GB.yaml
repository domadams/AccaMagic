intro-header-one: "What we do..."
intro-paragraph-one: "We provide you with tips for football matches throughout the year. Covering over 20 european leagues, our tips are based on current season stats and form. Whilst we canâ€™t guarantee there will be tips every day, whenever there are matches that have passed our filters, the tips will be available for you online. Tips will be always be provided across the weekend (Fri-Sun) and whenever there are midweek games."
intro-paragraph-two: "Our tips concentrate only on league games and focus on the <strong>O1.5 goals, O2.5 goals</strong> and <strong>BTTS</strong> markets. Consisting of anything from 1 to 5 selections the tips can be combined to form an accumulator bet, or be used individually."

intro-header-two: "Beat the Bookies - Getting Value"
intro-paragraph-three: "Sometimes the bookmakers get it wrong. All of our selections take advantage of bookmakers' mistakes where the true odds are lower than the odds that the bookmaker is offering. This is called a VALUE bet."
intro-paragraph-four: "For example using the match <strong>Team A</strong> vs <strong>Team B:</strong>"
intro-paragraph-five: "<strong>Team A</strong> have gone <strong>over 2.5 goals</strong> in <strong>6/10</strong> matches <br/> <strong>Team B</strong> have gone <strong>over 2.5 goals</strong> in <strong>4/10</strong> matches"
intro-paragraph-six: "Combined, <strong>10/20</strong> matches have gone <strong>over 2.5 goals</strong>. The true odds are calculated as follows:"
intro-paragraph-seven: "<strong>20/10 = 2.00</strong>"
intro-paragraph-eight: "However the bookmakers are offering odds of <strong>2.10</strong>. As you know the true odds are <strong>2.00</strong>. You have <strong>VALUE</strong> here as the bookmakers odds are higher."
